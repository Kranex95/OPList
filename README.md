# OPList
A protection script for the OP on your server.

This script allows you to enable a user list on your server. In it, you can accept people who may have the OP on your server. If in case someone wanted to have it "in some illegal way", this script can save your server.

It has different options, such as kicking the user from the server when he gets the OP or when he tries to access the server having it. Every time the script detects that this user has the OP, the script itself will remove it without prior notice.
